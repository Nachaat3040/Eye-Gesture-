Open the Document or Source Code File: Locate and open the document titled "Code of Eye-Gesture Control of Computer Systems via Artificial Intelligence". 
Copy the Entire Code:  Once the document is open, select the entire code. You can usually do this by clicking at the beginning of the code, scrolling to the end, and then holding the Shift key while clicking at the end. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+A (Cmd+A on Mac) to select all.
Open PyCharm and Prepare for Code Entry: Launch PyCharm, the Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
Once the project is open, create a new Python file. You can do this by right-clicking in the project explorer area, selecting 'New', and then choosing 'Python File'. Name the file appropriately.
Paste the Copied Code: With the new Python file open, paste the copied code into this file. Use the Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on Mac) shortcut to paste.
Prepare for Running the Code: Before running the code, make sure your face is in view of your laptop's webcam. The code will likely use your webcam to track your eye and head movements for controlling the mouse pointer.
Run the Code: Execute the code by clicking on the run button in PyCharm or by pressing the appropriate keyboard shortcut, usually Shift+F10.
Ensure that PyCharm has the necessary permissions to access your webcam, as the code will need it to track your eye and head movements.
Control the Mouse with Your Eyes and Head: Once the code is running, you can start moving your eyes and head to control the mouse cursor on your screen. The specific movements that correspond to mouse actions should be detailed in the code documentation or comments.
